# remark-include

**Forked from Qard/remark-include and now work with remark-loader 2.0.0**

With remark-include, you can use @include statements to compose markdown
files together.

## Install

```package.json
"@reddds/remark-include": "git+ssh://git@github.com/Reddds/remark-include.git#master",
```

```console
npm install @reddds/remark-include,
```

## Usage

```js
var remark = require('remark')
var include = require('remark-include')

remark().use(include).processSync('@include first.md\n@include second.md').toString()
```

## NOTE

If remark is given string content, it will use process.cwd() as the directory
to resolve the include paths within that content. You can supply the working
directory using `remark.use(include, { cwd: __dirname })`. Alternatively,
you can use [VFiles](http://npmjs.org/package/vfile) rather than strings to
ensure correct path resolution.
